# Droyd Hackpad
Here is my hackpad for Athena/Highway! It includes 12 switches, an oled and a rotary encoder, and I plan to use this for simple gaming and music applications.
In the cad folder I have attached my main cad file, my components (including the files needed to print the case) and components I borrowed from online (credits are below).
In the kicad folder I attached my primary project files for the PCB.
